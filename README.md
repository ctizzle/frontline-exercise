# frontline-exercise

This is my applicaiton for the Frontline Data & Analytics React UI Exercise. This exercise required using GitHub's REST API to retrieve contributors from Facebook's React Repository and display them on this application. The contributors are populated on the left sidebar (the List View) and when clicked on, additional information about the contributor will be shown in the Detail View.

## How to run the application
There are two ways to run this application:
*  Feel free to clone this repository. Run 'npm install' to install all the necessary dependencies. Then run 'npm start' to begin the application
